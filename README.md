# Dylan A. Royston, PhD

I'm a research scientist, data engineer, and neurotechnology advocate. 

Currently I work as a data engineer at Manifold, designing and deploying high-performance data platforms.

Previously I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Pediatric Brain Electrophysiology Lab with Dr. Taylor Abel (UPMC), using high-density intracranial EEG and machine learning to study human auditory processing.

I earned my PhD working in the [Rehab Neural Engineering Lab](http://rnel.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh, where I contributed to the development of intracortical brain-computer interfaces.
